# üìä n8n Workflow ‚Äì TikTok Competitor Data Scraper

## üìù Description
This workflow was built in **n8n** to automate the process of **scraping competitor accounts on TikTok**.  
The scraped data (e.g., video stats, captions, engagement metrics) is collected on a daily basis and then stored for further marketing analysis.  
This allows the marketing team to monitor competitor activity and trends without having to manually visit each account.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Steps
1. **Schedule Trigger**  
   - Runs automatically once a day.  

2. **Apify Actor / HTTP Request Node**  
   - Executes a scraper to fetch competitor TikTok data.  
   - Extracts details such as video title, views, likes, comments, and publish time.  

3. **Transform Data (Function Node)**  
   - Cleans and structures the raw JSON into tabular format.  

4. **Google Sheets / Database Node**  
   - Saves the processed data into Google Sheets (or database if needed).  

5. **Optional: Notification Node (Telegram/Slack)**  
   - Sends a notification when new competitor data has been stored.
